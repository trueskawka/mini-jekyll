*This is a living document. The ideas in it are subject to change as I explore while learning and implementing them.*

I want to learn in a few areas that are important for me:

- computer science fundamentals
- functional programming with Haskell
- music theory to be better at playing ukulele (and composing music in the future)
- drawing while I learn
- creating animations from my drawings

Since all those areas are interdependent for me, and that's apparently how my brain works in general, I want to devise a learning campaign with multiple adventures, that will help me grow.

My long-term capstone goal is building an application for learning music theory with ukulele, with hand-drawn graphics and Haskell on the backend.

## Current stats

- computer science fundamentals: 4/10
- functional programming with Haskell: 3/10
- music theory: 2/10
- drawing while I learn: 7/10
- animating: 4/10

## First adventure - Computer Science fundamentals

Goal: 

- to improve my understanding of the fundamentals of Computer Science:
    - how computers work
    - data structures
    - algorithms
    - design patterns
    - programming languages
- to get back to Haskell
- to share blog posts and cute animations

## Initial plan (6 weeks)

### Week 0 - Planning and prep

Goals:

- [ ]  learn to make GIFs
- [ ]  set up my Haskell learning environment
- [ ]  sketch the plan for week 1

### Week 1 - How computers work?

Goals:

- [ ]  get to drawing some CS related ideas
- [ ]  get a better grasp on understanding of the hardware

Scope:

- [ ]  bits, bytes and other creatures
- [ ]  numbers: binary, hexadecimal etc.
- [ ]  hardware (chips, cpu, memory, disk)

### Week 2 - Basic data structures

Scope:

- [ ]  linked lists
- [ ]  stacks and queues
- [ ]  trees
- [ ]  how types work in Haskell

### Week 3 - Intro algorithms

Scope:

- [ ]  why are graphs? what are they useful for?
- [ ]  to get recursion you need to get recursion
- [ ]  DFS
- [ ]  BFS

### Weeks 4-5 - Sorting problems

Scope:

- [ ]  what's hard about sorting?
- [ ]  selection sort
- [ ]  bubble sort
- [ ]  insertion sort
- [ ]  merge sort
- [ ]  quick sort
