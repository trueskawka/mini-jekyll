I recently listened to an episode of the 99% Invisible podcast on [curb cuts](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/curb-cuts/transcript/) 
and it made me pause to appreciate some of the curb cuts I experienced. One with 
the most profound impact on my life is the Internet.

Without it I wouldn’t be where I am. I wouldn’t have learned 
English well enough to be confident and fluent without all those hours binge-watching 
*Bones* and *Grey’s Anatomy*. I wouldn’t reignite my interest in programming without 
free MOOCs and open-source communities. I would never go to New York to join the Recurse 
Center, I wouldn’t go to meetups to make friends and find jobs, I finally wouldn’t meet 
my partner and move to Canada.

The Internet gave me opportunities and support I needed to take advantage of them. A space
to explore, experiment and embarrass myself. A way to learn resilience and build up confidence
by overcoming challenges, making mistakes and getting back on my feet.

It's often a mixed bag, yet I can't be anything but grateful.
