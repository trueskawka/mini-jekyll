The first half of my Recurse Center batch ended last week and since then I've done some reevaluating. I've read all of my daily logs and observed the changes in my interests and approach. Even though it was to be expected, I felt uneasy with how many things I've tried and quit over the past six weeks. As I often do when in need, I turned to Internet to find the answers I needed, reasoning that there probably is some kind of economical and/or mathematical theory on quitting. I wasn't disappointed.
_𝑥_1_,_𝑥_2_… _𝑥_𝑁_

$$
R_{\mu \nu} - {1 \over 2}g_{\mu \nu}\,R + g_{\mu \nu} \Lambda
= {8 \pi G \over c^4} T_{\mu \nu}
$$

$$
x_{1}, x_{2} … x_{N}
$$
`y_{1}, y_{2} … y_{N}`

`n`
`y_{n}`

`\frac{1}{N}`

`r`
`r < N`
`P(success) = P(r)`
`P’(r) = 0`

`n >= r`
`[1,n]`
`[1,r]`
`\frac{\frac{r}{n}}{\frac{1}{N}}`
