Brainfuck is an esoteric Turing-complete programming language with just eight instructions.

Esoteric in this context is used for languages that are fun to learn, as they are hard to program in, design to experiment with different ideas and not intended for practical use. It's more about learning to understand them than actually writing code in them.

Turing-complete describes any system that can be used to simulate any single-taped Turing machine. A Turing machine in turn is an abstract machine a mathematical concept defining a machine
