Last year, I became an alumni interviewer at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) - 
conducting conversational and pairing interviews with programmers who are 
interested in joining our community. Recently, I passed the 200 interviews mark 
and I think it's a good time to reflect on the ways I've grown through it.

# Scratchpad
### What we look for

The faculty at the Recurse Center is very open about [what we look for](https://www.recurse.com/what-we-look-for) - 
there is really nothing more. Those are the same admissions criteria that we 
apply to every interview.

### Training

Before I could get started conducting interviews, I had to go through training 
with experienced alumni interviewers.

### All the things I've learned

0. My name is very foreign

I am from Poland and my name is apparently very tricky to pronounce, although it 
doesn't have any diacritical symbols (it would be much more fun if it was `Ąłićją`). 
To add to the confusion, one of the facilitators at RC is Alicia, who sends out tons 
of admissions emails, and very rarely people notice the `j` in my name. 

1. My accent is not so bad

There was only one time I felt like my accent is not helping with the communication. 
Most of the time, non-native speakers confuse me for a Brit (boosting my ego), and 
native speakers ask if I have studied in Britain (which boosts my ego even more). 

2. Tons of resources



3. All the setups

4. Popular themes
a. functional programming (Haskell, OCaml, Rust)
b. AI, machine learning, deep learning
c. compilers
d. open-source
e. security
f. philosophical implications of technology
g. game development
h. graphics programming
i. distributed systems
