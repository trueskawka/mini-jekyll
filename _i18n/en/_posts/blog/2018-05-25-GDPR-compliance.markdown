As the [General Data Protection Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) compliance deadline has 
arrived today, I have removed all tracking scripts from my website. 

I did it to protect myself, as being self-employed implies I'm a legal entity. I never collected any data
beyond user visits, be it personal information or passwords.

I have only used two tracking scripts, both external:
- Google Analytics for getting info on the website traffic - removed completely

- Recurse Center script for referrals - I removed the script and now only use a static link for referrals 
(even the RC logo animation is in pure CSS)

Since this website is being hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), some data is still
being tracked by GitHub servers for providing the service. I don't have control over what GitHub might 
be tracking, but I don't provide any additional data to them. Any data GitHub might have on users 
after visiting this website is what they willfully provide by browsing the Internet.

I might add a new tracking script to this website in the future, after I make sure I understand if and how 
Google Analytics is compliant with GDPR.
