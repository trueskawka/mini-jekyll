While looking for a new job after moving to Canada, I decided
to create a simple tool for generating the resume. The European
format I was used to is very different from the North American
approach, so I wanted to have some fun while working on it.

This project uses:
- Gulp for tasks (generating HTML, reading JSON data etc.)
- Nunjucks for the HTML template
- JSON for storing the resume data
- CSS for styling

Check out my pure HTML + CSS [resume](/resume) created with this 
tool.
