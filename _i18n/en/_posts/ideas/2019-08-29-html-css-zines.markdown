I wanted to share my handwritten notes on Haskell and other
things I'm learning in a more accessible way (previously, I was
using Notability). I also wanted to create a pure Node.js setup
for generating static websites, without using any external libraries,
just for fun.

This project uses:
- HTML for content
- CSS for styling
- a custom hand-drawn font
- Node.js for generating output HTML

Some zines I created with this setup:
- [Haskell: intro]({{ site.baseurl }}/zines/haskell_intro)
- [Haskell: functions]({{ site.baseurl }}/zines/haskell_functions)
