## Hello!

My name is
<ruby>Alicja <rp>(</rp><rt>uh-LEE-ts-ya</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> and this is my
personal website.

I write about learning things and exploring ideas. In no particular order, I
like Haskell, CSS, writing documentation, building systems, analyzing data,
drawing, learning languages, and chocolate.

Professionally, I work at
<a href="https://www.mobify.com/">Mobify</a>, building developer tools for
progressive web apps. I am also a part of the
<a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=f02b0374c676201ec7719debf8701438">Recurse Center</a>
- a community where programmers take time off to focus on their growth.
